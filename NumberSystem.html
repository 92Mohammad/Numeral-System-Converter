            <h1>What are number system?</h1>
            <div class="content"> A number system is a way of representing and expressing numbers using a set of symbols
                and rules. It provides a systematic approach to counting, calculating, and manipulating quantities or
                values. Different number systems have been developed and used throughout history,
                each with its own unique properties and applications.
            </div><br>


            <div style = "font-weight : bold;"> There are most commonly used number system given below : </div>
            <br>
            <div class="content"><span class=type-heading>1. Decimal System (Base-10): </span>The decimal system is the
                most commonly used number system in everyday life. It uses ten symbols (0-9) to represent numbers.
                Each position in a decimal number represents a power of 10. For example, the number 123 represents (1 x
                10^2) + (2 x 10^1) + (3 x 10^0), which is equal to 100 + 20 + 3. The decimal
                system is intuitive for humans because we have ten fingers, which is why it is widely used for counting,
                arithmetic operations, and representing real-world quantities.
            </div><br>
            <div class="content"><span class="type-heading">2. Binary System (Base-2): </span> The binary system is
                fundamental in computer science and digital electronics. It uses only two symbols, 0 and 1, to represent
                numbers. Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2.
                Computers and digital systems use binary because electronic circuits have two stable states: on and off.
                In binary, the number 1011 represents (1 x 2^3) + (0 x 2^2) + (1 x 2^1) + (1 x 2^0), which is equal to 8
                + 0 + 2 + 1 = 11 in decimal. Binary numbers can also represent logical values, such as true/false or
                yes/no.
            </div><br>

            <div class="content"><span class="type-heading">3. Octal System (Base-8):</span>The octal system uses eight
                symbols (0-7) to represent numbers. Each position in an octal number represents a power of 8.
                Octal numbers are used in some programming languages and digital systems. For example, the octal number
                77 represents (7 x 8^1) + (7 x 8^0), which is equal to 63 in decimal.
            </div><br>
            <div><span class="type-heading">4. Hexadecimal System (Base-16):</span>The hexadecimal system uses sixteen
                symbols, including the digits 0-9 and the letters A-F, to represent numbers. Each position in a
                hexadecimal number represents a power of 16. Hexadecimal is commonly used in computer science and
                programming. It is often used to represent memory addresses, binary data, and color values. For
                instance, the hexadecimal number 3F7 represents (3 x 16^2) + (15 x 16^1) + (7 x 16^0), which is equal to
                1015 in decimal.
